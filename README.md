## Game Version: v0.6.6.2 Milestone
## Website: https://piratedheat.top (down until the 25th of november)
### This is not an executable launcher anymore, all files and mods are now directly downloadable from the website!

Info: Pirated Heat Launcher is back! Same creator, github has been deleted, there is a new Youtube video on my account (Johnny on the Spot) to prove my authenticity.
